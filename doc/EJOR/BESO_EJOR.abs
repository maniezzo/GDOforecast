We introduce the Bootstrap Enhanced Scenario Optimization (BESO) framework, a novel methodology for prescriptive analytics under uncertainty. BESO addresses the critical challenge of generating reliable demand scenarios from volatile, short, and non-stationary time series data. The core innovation lies in delegating the modeling of uncertainties to the Maximum Entropy Bootstrap (MEB) integrated with bagging, a technique that uniquely preserves the complex autocorrelation structure of empirical time series forecasts, enabling the generation of statistically coherent scenarios. We further extend MEB through an objective-augmented formulation that incorporates downstream recourse signals into the resampling mechanism. These statistically rich scenarios are then integrated into a deterministic equivalent model to derive accountable and optimized prescriptions. We demonstrate the framework's power using a real-world case study in tactical inventory allocation. Our findings, also validated against an extensive set of artificial benchmark instances, demonstrate the effectiveness of MEB-enhanced forecasting in optimization. BESO establishes a new, generalizable paradigm for robust decision-making derived from noisy univariate data series.
